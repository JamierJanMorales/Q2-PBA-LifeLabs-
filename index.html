        <h1>My Experience of all EG's in Quarter 2</h1>
        <h2>Eg8-9</h2>
        From my experience in Eg8-9 is actually Good because i just learned what do i need for streaming like tools or equipments. I learned that there are different types of contents and each contents has a different equipments used. For Example, On "Mukbang" contents the right or tools needed is <b>microphone and Camera</b> for them to record themselves eating. And for "Gaming" they use <b>microphone,Camera,Gaming phone/pc.</b> for theto record themselves playing online/offline Games.
        <p>
            <h2>Eg10</h2>
        Here in Eg10, I Encountered difficulties because of The Contents. What i mean is that i learned different types of contents for streaming. And what i mean is that i had difficulties thinking what content should i stream because there are so many types of streaming which is Mukbang,Gaming,Tutorials,Beauty(makeup) etc.    
        

        <p>
            <h2>Eg11</h2>
            From my Experience, Eg11 is Actually Amazing. Because the topic is for the viewers, I learned that streaming also needs design, Design that can attract the viewers. And also the theme is very important becuase its for the viewers to stay in the stream until the end. because theme in streaming is for the viewers or the audience to be happy or it depends on the mood of the theme.
        

        <p>
            <h2>Eg12</h2>
            For me i think Eg12 topic is the most very important part, Because it's all about your privacy. I learned here what i can do and what i can't do. and when it's about privacy, your personal information is included. The examples of the information is Password,Email,Phone number,Age,Home address. When you expose your password or personal information is that you can consider your career over or messed up because when someone or scammers knows your password, they have a full control in your account. That means they can expose your privacy and they can ruin your account. And when that happened your reputation will be affected
        
        
        <p>
            <h2>Eg13</h2>
            For me Eg13 is the part that you think alot, because this is the part where i plan for my stream and how to promote my stream for more viewers. The promotion has the potential to help more people learn about me, my community, and my content. and for planning my stream is also important because Stream management plans can help identify both the demands of environmental attributes as well as the projects and approaches that will benefit those attributes.
        

        <p>
            <h2>Eg14</h2>
            here in the last Eg is fun because of the memes where you put it on your website. it's for the readers to take your website easy or they will find your website fun. and it's actually a cool Eg because it's where you plan what to put in my website.
